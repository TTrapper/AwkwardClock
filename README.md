# AwkwardClock
An Android widget that tells the time in a very awkward way ;) 

## Tells the correct time in a roundabout way:

<br/><br/>

## For experts: get precise (and very awkward) to the minute accuracy! 
![excattime_0](/Screenshots/exacttime_0.png)

<br/><br/>

## Optionally round to the nearest hour for a sliglty less awkward time:
![rounded_time](/Screenshots/roundedtime.png)

<br/><br/>

## Usage

This is an Android Studio project. The easiest way to get going is to install Android Studio and import this project.
The main logic for converting boring old normal time to awkward time can be found in `AwkwardClock/app/src/main/java/com/example/awkwardclock/AwkwardClock.java`
